# align-atlases-to-bbp

This repository contains scripts used to generate a finite element model of a rat head aligned to the Blue Brain Project Somatosensory cortex model.

## Dependencies

This pieline depends on ANTs Version: 2.3.4.dev206-g2251c, antsPy version 0.2.6, and on fsl flirt version 6.0

## Workflow

1. The mapping from SIGMA atlas labels to Waxholm atlas labels is created semi-automatically with matchRegions.py. This function loads the lists of tissues for the Waxholm atlas (data/whs_sd_tissuelist.txt) and for the SIGMA atlas (../data/SIGMA_Anatomical_Brain_Atlas_Labels.txt) and creates a mapping between them using fuzzy string matching. For each pair, the user must either accept the match, by entering the return key, or provide an alternative region name.

2. The relabelled SIGMA atlas is written using writeRegions.py. This script loads the original SIGMA atlas (data/SIGMA_Anatomical_Brain_Atlas.nii) and replaces its labels with the Waxholm labels from the previous step.

3. The relabelled SIGMA atlas is masked using maskBrain.py. This script creates a copy of the relabelled SIGMA atlas, in which only background and non-background are distinguished.

4. The relabelled SIGMA atlas label field is mapped to the Waxholm atlas using mapSigToWax.sh. This script uses FSL FLIRT to align the relabeld SIGMA atlas to the Waxholm atlas (data/WHS_atlas_prealigned.nii.gz). The mask of the SIGMA atlas, calculated in the previous step, is also used as an input to this step.

5. The script transform.sh is run next. This first calls the script transform.py, which converts the FSL transformation matrix to an ANTs transformation matrix. transform.sh then applies the ANTs transformation to the original SIGMA atlas; this produces a Waxholm rat with the original SIGMA labels.  This step then makes use the transform defined in data/whs2osparc_bsyn_msb3_Composite.h5, which aligns the waxholm rat with the oSPARC rat, to align the SIGMA-labeled waxholm rat to the oSPARC rat, thus producing an oSPARC rat with SIGMA labels.

6. The mapping from the SIGMA labels to the Paxinos-Watson labels is calculated using the script **matchRegions_SigmaToPW.py**. This loads the lists of tissues for the Paxinos-Watson atlas (data/PW_RBSC_6th_cortex.txt for the cortex and data/PW_RBSC_6th_lut.txt for the whole brain) and creates a mapping between them and the list of tissues in the SIGMA atlas using fuzzy string matching.

7. The oSPARC rat with SIGMA labels is then relabelled with the Paxinos-Watson regions using writeRegionsPW.py

8. Next, the script eval.py is run. This script creates a mask of the osparc rat, and of the paxinos-watson atlas.

9. The masked image created in step 8 is aligned to the PW atlas using registerPaxLabelsToFem.sh This script loads the Paxinos Watson atlas (data/PW_RBSC_6th_indexed_volume.nii.gz), the oSparc rat with paxinos-watson labels, and the masks for each of these two atlases, and uses FSL FLIRT to align the oSparc rat to the PW atlas.

10. The transform calculated in the previous step is applied to the cropped oSPARC rat head label field using transformFullMesh.sh. This script first calls transformFullMesh.py, which loads the FSL transformation matrix that maps the osparc rat to the Paxinos-Watson atlas, and writes it as an ANTs transform. The script then resizes the paxions-watson atlas to match the size of the cropped osparc rat head (data/20200810_segmentation_cropped.nii.gz) plus 100 pixels of padding.
11. The script transformFullMesh.sh then loads the oSparc  rat head (data/20200810_segmentation_cropped.nii.gz),  the padded Paxinos-Watson image, and aligns the former to the latter using the ANTs transform generated by transformFullMesh.py. This step also applies a scaling of 0.92 in order to match the juvenile rat.
